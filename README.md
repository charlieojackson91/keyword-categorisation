# keyword-categorisation
given a list of keywords and a predefined Python dictionary (with topic and topic category i.e. if the topic is 'holiday', the associated top category could be 'travel'), the script categorises keywords using NLTK. After the categorisation has run, the files are written to CSV. 

It uses some simple NLP practices using NLTK Python package including:
- removal of stop words
- stemming using Porter Stemer
